<p>Genila Naftal Hiel, A Tanzanian girl, 20 years old. Currently a second year student at Mzumbe University pursuing Bachelor of science in Economics- Project Planning and Management. I love learning new things every now and then when i get chance to. I am passionate about creating impact to the people in different group to the society. I love reading and writing. I write articles about different matters  </p>

<p>In 2019, I found a youth organization called INSPIRING GENERATION which deals with connecting youths from different areas particularly universities students and provide them platform to share challenges and experiences in different fields.  </p>

<p>Since am passionate on reading and writing, I also created a Reading and writing platform called LETS READ which works in social medias accounts but also in PODCASTS, where readers and writers get the chance to share their experiences in reading and writing. On may 2020, I created a blog called GENNIE PLUS (gennieplus.blogspot.com) where I share different inspiring stories from different people, articles and tips on different matters.   </p>

<p> I've been working with different organization and corporates. Currently working as Assistant Editor at Inspire Magazine Globally. But also as business creativity manager at The Event Corps. Also as a chairman of KIJIWENI PROJECT under Resource and Incubation Center at Mzumbe University. </p>

<p>Participating in different activities makes me gaining more experiences in different fields but also be the icon to other youths especially girls. I once chosen as a Friday icon at Mzumbe University under Mzumbe Media.
Actually am doing many things outside the class, but having a time for each one makes me not to loose in any of them. I have time for each one and nothing can interfere the other's time.
Am youth passionate and being that way, makes me want to introduce different platforms where youths will get a chance to brand themselves and show what they can do. Actually, that makes me introducing different platforms.
  </p>

<h2 class="section-heading">Does Age matter?</h2>

<p>  Age does not matter. People used to be amazed when they do connect my age and the activities am doing. But what i can say is being ready and committed to my passions made me to start achieveing even a little, to my goals. Showing off my abilities once given a stage to show it. This makes people to see something potential in me and allow me to contribute my ideas and even work with them. Age is just a number to any ambitious youth and girl. </p>

<p> To all youths,
Explore yoursef to know your abilities, utilize them, use them to improve yourself and improving the society as well in all aspects of life. To know yourself is the first attempt to success.
We are all unlimited.
